Also got support for 1541C/1541-II drives in the process, as well as supporting DolphinDOS 2.0

I did various layouts for the project, which later evolved into the amazing MeGALoDOS by tommy_nrw (in which I had no involvement, due to departing the Commodore community)

Full run of the 64er Speedtest (track display is *not* part of the project, but obviously compatible) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nbLhu1RDvs

Only userport variant for now - expansion port variant maybe some day, as others did the layouts there.

Additionally to the files found here you'll need a 1541/1571 parallelcable with the usual pinout.
